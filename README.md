## STOP SOPA

This repository is my take on "going dark" for the [January 18 blackout to protest SOPA](http://sopastrike.com/).

You can use the provided **`index.html`** as your site's homepage on January 18 as one possible way to participate.

I felt inspired by the "going dark" theme.  I've been calling my representatives in Congress, but this gave me another outlet for my frustration with this legislation.  I place this code in the public domain.  I require no attribution.
